# Automated Vulnerability Results Report Action

## Description

An action to create a CSV report for the following security testing tools based on their JSON reports.

**Notes:**
- The action will only create a CSV report if the JSON report exists.
- The action uses the NVD API to acquire additional information about CVE vulnerabilities for SCA reports.
- The action uses the OpenCVE API to acquire additional information about CWE vulnerabilities for SAST reports.
  - OpenCVE API is rate limited to 100 requests per minute. The action caches CWE details to reduce the number of requests made.
